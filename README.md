# M1-tensorflow-benchmark


TensorFlow (v2.7.0) benchmark results on an M1 Macbook Air 2020 laptop (macOS Monterey v12.1). 

I was initially testing if TensorFlow was installed correctly so that code outside any context manager automatically runs on the GPU by using the `with tf.device('/GPU:0')` context manager. It would be interesting to 
compare this with free GPU services, so I also included Kaggle and Colab in the tests. Also tested M1's CPU.

This plot shows training time (y-axis) of an MLP with 5, 10, 15, 20 (x-axis) hidden layers of size 1024, and ReLU activation, trained on 50,000 CIFAR-10 images for 3 epochs.


The M1 looks comparable to a K80 which is nice if you always get locked out of Colab (like I do). But temps were worrying (~65 Â°C) 
this laptop is fanless after all. ðŸ¥² Kaggle's P100 is 4x faster which is expected as the P100 provides 1.6x more GFLOPs and stacks 3x the memory bandwidth of the K80.
The graph also confirms that the [TF installation works](https://github.com/jeffheaton/t81_558_deep_learning/blob/master/install/tensorflow-install-mac-metal-jul-2021.ipynb) 
and that TF code automatically runs on the GPU!

## Extending the results 

1. Run the relevant parts of the script `run.py` on your environment, and save the results as `results_<YOUR_ENV_NAME>.csv` by changing the last line of `run.py`.
2. Download the resulting CSV file and save it in the root directory alongside the other `results_*.csv` files.
3. Then run `plot_results.py`. See `results.png`. Another line graph of your results should be added to the above plot. ðŸ¥³
